# Sentiment Analysis on Sentiment140 RNN vs LSTM

This project applies deep learning models (LSTM and RNN) to the **Sentiment140** dataset containing 1.6 million tweets.  
The workflow includes **data preprocessing**, **train/test splitting**, **model training**, **evaluation**, and a **comparative analysis** between LSTM and RNN.  
A detailed **PDF report** summarizing the methodology, results, and findings is included in the repository.
